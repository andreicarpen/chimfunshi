			<div id="bp"><p id="space">&nbsp;</p> 1983 when a game ranger brought a badly wounded infant chimpanzee to the cattle ranch of David and Sheila Siddle, a British couple who had lived in along the Zambian copperbelt since the 1950s. The Siddles nursed that chimp – nicknamed "Pal" – back to health, thereby establishing a tradition of care and respect that forms the legacy of the sanctuary.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p id="c">Although chimpanzee rehabilitation is the primary focus (see more)</p>
<div id="cp"><p id="space">&nbsp;</p> of Chimfunshi, other animals benefit from the Siddles' care and attention as well. Antelopes, baboons, monkeys, tortoises, squirrels, bush babies, dogs and birds have all been nursed back to health at the orphanage and the biggest resident of all is Billy the hippo.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p id="d">At the moment, in the sanctuary lives (see more)</p>
<div id="dp"><p id="space">&nbsp;</p> five social groups inhabit the free-range enclosures that span 1,100 acres at the orphanage, including three 500-acre enclosures, the largest area ever set aside for captive primates. From 2012 Chimfunshi started with the first phase of trying to let the boys outside, right there at the Orphanage.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p id="e">The Siddles’ work has won them a (see more)</p>
<div id="ep"><p id="space">&nbsp;</p> steady stream of honors and awards, including the United Nations Environment Programme’s Global 500 Award (2000), the Audi / Terra Nova nomination (2001), a special commendation from the Nedbank / mail & Guardian Green Trust Awards (2000), and the Jane Goodall Award (995). In 2001, the Siddles were granted MBEs by Queen Elizabeth II in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace.</p></div>

<p id="f">In 2002, Sheila Siddle published (see more)</p>

<h3>About chimpanzee</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p id="g">The chimpanzee, scientifically known as (see more)</p>
<div id="gp"><p id="space">&nbsp;</p> Pan Troglodytes, is the animal kingdom's closest relative to humans. In fact, chimpanzees are more similar to man than they are other apes, and research indicates that chimpanzees are over 99 percent genetically identical to humans.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p id="h">Chimpanzees are native to (see more)</p>
<div id="hp"><p id="space">&nbsp;</p> Equatorial Africa, and once roamed in their millions across 25 countries in West, Central and East Africa. But relentless poaching, logging, habitat destruction, and human encroachment have reduced the wild population to less than an estimated 150 000, and they are classified as an Endangered Species.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p id="i">Chimpanzees are social animals with (see more)</p>
<div id="ip"><p id="space">&nbsp;</p> strong family bonds. They live in large groups of 25 or more, and female chimpanzees are attentive mothers, often doting on their offspring for the first four or five years. Chimpanzees are also efficient hunters and tool makers, and exhibit many of the same emotions once thought exclusive to humans, such as jealousy, envy, compassion, greed, sloth, avarice, and malice.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p id="j">Chimpanzees continue to be hunted down and (see more)</p>
<div id="jp"><p id="space">&nbsp;</p> poached in their hundreds each year. The illegal hunting and subsequent sale of primate meat -- known as "bushmeat" -- is a thriving commercial enterprise and is on the increase with the depletion of forests. Sadly, it is believed that the killer human viruses such as Ebola and AIDS are directly related to the consumption of this ape meat, yet the practice shows no signs of abating.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p id="k">Chimpanzee babies who survive the (see more)</p>
<div id="kp"><p id="space">&nbsp;</p> hunting ordeal are often sold as pets, zoo animals, or circus performers, while some wind up in medical research.</div>
